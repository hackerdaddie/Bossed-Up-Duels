### Rules

- **No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or any sort of bigotry, even if it is a joke. You will be punished without warning.**

- No RDM (killing a player without flourishing) in any form. This includes mass RDM and revenge RDM.

- No use of bows allowed.

- No building is allowed if you are disrupting others. An admin may ask you to stop building. Building an arena can be coordinated with the players/admins online.

- No glitches/hacking.

- Be respectful to others. Do not: troll, harass, dox, etcetera.

- Stay away from discussion or media about current events. We play video games to distract us from the real world, it has no place here. Content that either directly spotlights current events, or content that merely references political events will be removed with no warning, and more punishments could follow alongside the removal. 

- E-dating, fawning, excessive flirting or such type of role playing is not allowed, period. 

- No spamming chat.

The entire staff team can interpret these rules (within reason) and respond how they see fit. Something that is questionable, but not explicitly written in the rules, is still subject to punishment - with staff having the final say on everything.
